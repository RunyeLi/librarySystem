            <!-- scripts, at the bottom of <body>, in order to: 
                1. give the priority of HTTP requests to the visual display instead of the logic of interaction or dynamica, 
                2. avoid impatience of users caused by waiting for js loading, 
                3. make sure the DOM can be accessed due to the loaded elements

            I put some global functions into individual files as the module, so that I can call and reuse it in several js files

            in addition, I use separate js files for different kinds of functionalities, so that I can structure the files well

            the module files should be loaded first, so that the js codes in other files can reuse their module-->

            <script type="text/javascript" src="ajaxModule.js"></script>
            <script type="text/javascript" src="eventTrackerModule.js"> </script>
            <script type="text/javascript" src="jsForFunctionality/user.js"> </script>

            <!--the index.js should be loaded at last, since it includes all the functionalities and the functions in other files will be called by it-->

            <script type="text/javascript" src="jsForFunctionality/index.js"> </script>
        </body>
    </html>


<!-- the reasons why I use one html to contain all the functionalities are:
    1. compared to lots of web pages, it is more convenient for maintaince, debugging and further design in one html since I only need to debug and modify once on some common issues
    2. using javaScript to select related content in the main part also can avoid the situation that one broken down functionality affacts other functionalities negatively
    3. make sure the users (librarians) can use any functionality in one step by clicking on the option item only
    4. when sb wants to add or remove a functionality, only need to add or delete the option item in the html file instead of making a new html
    5. my web page will be more dynamic through showing of different contents by click event on different items
    6. using single html to contain all functionalities seems more difficult than creating lots of similar html files because it tends to have extra demands on javaScript, and I want to take the challenge

this .html has passed the document checking in https://validator.w3.org/nu/#file with no errors or warnings finally-->
